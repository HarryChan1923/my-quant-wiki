                <h1>Quantitative Overview</h1>
                <p>This page provides a detailed introduction to the core concepts, historical evolution, and key
                    examples of quantitative investing, including the workings of quantitative hedge funds.</p>
                <h1>What is a Quantitative Hedge Fund?</h1>
                <p>The term "quantitative investing" does not describe a single unified strategy; rather, it explains
                    how specific strategies are developed and implemented. The difference between a quantitative
                    strategy and a discretionary strategy lies in the way the strategy is created and executed.</p>
                <p>Quantitative strategies use computer algorithms to make systematic, automated trading decisions.
                    However, the ultimate responsibility for quantitative trading remains with people—not machines. It
                    is humans who conduct research, decide on strategies, choose which securities to trade, select data,
                    and determine the hardware and connectivity required. Those involved are often called "quants." </p>
                <h2>Classification of Quantitative Trading Strategies</h2>
                <p>Quantitative trading strategies are generally classified based on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Asset classes</li>
                    <li>Signal types</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These two factors typically determine the sub-strategies. For example:</p>
                <p>If a fund mainly uses short-term, technical signals to trade individual stocks with brief holding
                    periods, it may be classified as a statistical arbitrage fund. In contrast, if a fund only trades
                    "macro instruments" such as futures, forex, and bonds—predicting prices as functions of short‐term
                    technical indicators and long‐term fundamental indicators—it may be classified as a quantitative
                    macro fund.</p>
                <h2>Types of Quantitative Hedge Funds</h2>
                <h2>Most Common Quantitative Strategies</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Statistical Arbitrage in Equities</li>
                    <li>Quantitative Equity Market Neutral Strategy</li>
                    <li>Managed Futures/CTA</li>
                    <li>Quantitative Macro</li>
                    <li>Alternative Risk Premia</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This list is not exhaustive; other strategy classifications exist, for example:</p>
                <p>Multi-strategy Quantitative: Funds that trade multiple asset classes simultaneously and/or combine
                    short-term statistical arbitrage with long-term models, often categorized as "statistical
                    arbitrage."</p>
                <p>Quantitative Volatility: Funds that aim to capture changes in volatility are sometimes termed
                    volatility traders, even if executed via a quantitative process. If combined with other quantitative
                    strategies, they are usually classified under “statistical arbitrage.”</p>

                <h2>Statistical Arbitrage in Equities</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Statistical arbitrage funds typically utilize price data and its derivatives (such as correlations,
                    volatility, and other forms of market data like volume and order book information) to detect
                    patterns. By studying historical data, they identify repeatable patterns and data correlations to
                    help managers forecast future stock returns over short periods. Rigorous statistical analysis and
                    backtesting are used to verify relationships. The strategy aims for risk-adjusted returns that
                    exceed those of more “traditional” hedge funds, though actual returns depend heavily on leverage and
                    volatility tolerance.</p>
                <h3>Signal Types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mean Reversion: Seeks to exploit short-term price imbalances where prices are expected to return
                        to their "equilibrium" level.</li>
                    <li>Momentum: Searches for patterns in price data that indicate a continuation of price movements
                        (i.e. trends).</li>
                    <li>Event Driven: Includes factors such as analyst earnings expectations, news sentiment, mergers
                        and acquisitions, stock buybacks, index rebalancing, and insider trading.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some statistical arbitrage funds may also incorporate long-term models driven by fundamental data. If
                    these fundamentally driven models are the main risk drivers, the fund is closer to a quantitative
                    market neutral strategy (QEMN).</p>
                <h3>Performance Across Markets</h3>
                <p>Statistical arbitrage portfolios generally generate returns on top of broad market movements. During
                    periods of soaring inter-stock correlations and market volatility spikes, statistical arbitrage may
                    experience sharp drawdowns. However, extreme volatility is often followed by attractive
                    opportunities. Environments of low volatility and low trading volume may be unfavorable, while
                    moderate price fluctuations and discrepancies are conducive to success. Sudden risk events or
                    unforeseeable factors may challenge the model.</p>
                <h3>Example Trade</h3>
                <p>Suppose the fund identifies that Coca-Cola and Pepsi have historically been highly correlated. If
                    Pepsi’s stock drops briefly due to a liquidity imbalance, the fund might buy the undervalued Pepsi
                    while shorting the overvalued Coca-Cola, expecting the price ratio to revert to its historical
                    average.</p>
                <h3>Risk/Return Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Market Neutral: Typically operates with very low beta. Other common factor exposures are usually
                    hedged. Leverage may be higher but is managed through stop-losses, position size limits, and factor
                    exposure constraints.</p>
                <h2>Quantitative Equity Market Neutral Strategy (“QEMN”)</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The QEMN strategy uses a blend of fundamental and event-driven data (such as analyst earnings
                    forecasts, financial data) that is processed systematically to score/rank stocks. By means of
                    optimization or simple rules, the strategy constructs a market neutral long-short portfolio while
                    minimizing industry exposures.</p>
                <h3>Signal Types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fundamental Data: Earnings, revenue, profit margins, cash flow, etc.</li>
                    <li>Technical Data: Moving averages, RSI, volume, price momentum, etc.</li>
                    <li>Sentiment Data: News articles, social media posts, analyst reports, etc.</li>
                    <li>Alternative Data: Such as satellite imagery, credit card data, weather patterns, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Machine learning algorithms are used to screen and combine these signals to ultimately build a market
                    neutral long-short portfolio.</p>
                <h3>Performance Across Markets</h3>
                <p>Like statistical arbitrage, QEMN can face challenges during periods of extreme volatility and rising
                    correlations. It tends to perform better when stock prices are more driven by fundamentals and there
                    are reasonable pricing discrepancies.</p>
                <h3>Example Trade</h3>
                <p>
                    Data Collection & Processing: Collect financial statements, earnings reports, and alternative data
                    such as news articles and social media sentiment.<br>
                    Signal Generation: Compute signals for value (e.g. P/E ratio), growth (e.g. earnings growth rate),
                    momentum (price trends), and quality (ROE, debt levels, etc.).<br>
                    Portfolio Construction & Risk Management: Select roughly 100 long and 100 short stocks while
                    ensuring industry and market-cap neutrality, using stop-losses and position limits to manage risk.
                </p>
                <h3>Risk/Return Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Low beta and market neutrality. Some QEMN strategies may exhibit specific style factor exposures (for
                    example, value or momentum) and sometimes include timing signals. Leverage levels are typically in
                    the 3–8x range and are maintained neutrally through hedging.</p>
                <h2>Managed Futures/CTA</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) typically take primarily directional positions in indices or "macro
                    instruments" (such as futures or forex) in a systematic manner. The most common strategy is trend
                    following, using technical price signals to buy rising markets and sell falling ones, and
                    rebalancing positions when trends reverse. As the trend following concept has become popular, some
                    more "generalized" CTA strategies now boast lower fees.</p>
                <h3>Signal Types</h3>
                <p>Most CTAs rely on price and volume data to identify trends. They may also incorporate yield curve
                    information, seasonality, mean reversion, or pattern recognition, and some even include fundamental
                    or alternative data. Short-term high-frequency patterns may also be examined.</p>
                <h3>Performance Across Markets</h3>
                <p>CTAs typically show low correlations with stocks and bonds, often performing well in periods of high
                    volatility or crises while suffering in choppy or low volatility, range-bound markets. They tend to
                    generate significant profits in sustained trending markets; however, abrupt reversals or rapid
                    changes in macro conditions can result in prolonged drawdowns.</p>
                <h3>Example Trade</h3>
                <p>
                    Directional Position: For example, taking long and short positions in stock index futures.<br>
                    Relative Value: For example, trading the spread between Brent and WTI crude oil contracts, or
                    engaging in “curve trading” between different maturities of futures contracts.
                </p>
                <h3>Risk/Return Characteristics</h3>
                <p>
                    Diversification: Spanning stock indices, government bonds, commodity futures, and currency
                    futures.<br>
                    Low Correlation: Generally low correlation with stocks and bonds.<br>
                    High Volatility and Drawdowns: Expected Sharpe ratios are around 0.5–1.0, making them less suitable
                    for investors solely chasing high Sharpe.<br>
                    Capital Efficiency: Margins are typically only 10–25% of total equity.<br>
                    Mechanical Risk Control: The portfolio size is dynamically adjusted based on market conditions.
                </p>
                <h2>Quantitative Macro and Global Asset Allocation (“GAA”)</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Quantitative macro involves analyzing a wide array of economic, market, and other fundamental
                    indicators and making trading decisions based on statistical models. While it overlaps with CTAs in
                    trading futures and other macro instruments, quantitative macro tends to be driven by long-term
                    fundamentals (such as GDP, inflation, and exchange rates).</p>
                <p>Quantitative Macro/GAA funds typically:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus on relative value trading while sometimes taking directional positions.</li>
                    <li>Use a wide range of signals based on economic data, cross-country differences, alternative data,
                        and technical indicators.</li>
                    <li>Have holding periods ranging from several weeks to months, or even shorter.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Signal Types</h3>
                <p>
                    Macro-economic factors: GDP, inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, import/export data, etc.<br>
                    Traditional signals: Value, yield, momentum (trend), etc.<br>
                    More complex elements: Such as weather, transportation data, geopolitical events, and policy
                    changes.
                </p>
                <h3>Performance Across Markets</h3>
                <p>Quantitative macro tends to perform well during economic uncertainty such as recessions or
                    geopolitical crises. However, in stable markets with slow changes or when fundamentals are out of
                    sync with market prices, performance may suffer. Its effectiveness heavily depends on data quality
                    and the adaptability of the models.</p>
                <h3>Example Trade</h3>
                <p>
                    Relative Value Model on Macro Instruments: Trading based on differences in interest rates and
                    inflation forecasts affecting exchange rates.<br>
                    Cross-Asset Strategy: Taking long and short positions by dynamically exploiting relationships
                    between commodities, forex, and bonds.
                </p>
                <h3>Risk/Return Characteristics</h3>
                <p>
                    Similar to CTAs, it features low correlation and high liquidity.<br>
                    Vulnerable to unforeseen risk factors, necessitating careful risk management and model
                    adjustments.<br>
                    It should not exhibit a fixed long or short bias.<br>
                    Higher volatility than most hedge funds yet provides diversified returns in a portfolio.
                </p>
                <h2>Alternative Risk Premia</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Alternative Risk Premia (ARP) strategies aim to systematically harvest returns from specific risk
                    factors such as value, momentum, low volatility, high yield, convergence spreads, or M&A risk
                    premia. The concept is to capture these factor premiums through a replicable and dynamic
                    process—typically at lower fees—thereby diversifying exposures across multiple factors and markets
                    to enhance risk-adjusted returns.</p>
                <h3>Signal Types</h3>
                <p>Common factors include value, momentum, yield differentials, volatility, quality, liquidity, etc.
                    Each factor corresponds to specific trading rules (for example, buying undervalued and selling
                    overvalued stocks; going long on positive momentum and short on negative momentum). It may also
                    include risk arbitrage such as merger arbitrage or convertible arbitrage.</p>
                <h3>Performance Across Markets</h3>
                <p>ARP strategies may perform variably during market turbulence; their attraction lies in low
                    correlation with traditional assets. When asset correlations converge and extreme risk events occur,
                    ARP may also suffer drawdowns. Performance can vary greatly between ARP funds based on the chosen
                    factor mix and hedging methods.</p>
                <h3>Example Trade</h3>
                <p>
                    Spread Trade: Simultaneously buying the undervalued asset and shorting the overvalued one between
                    gold and silver to capture reversion.<br>
                    Carry Trade: Allocating positions to high-yield assets while hedging lower-yield assets by
                    exploiting interest rate or yield differentials.
                </p>
                <h3>Risk/Return Characteristics</h3>
                <p>The strategy is designed to be market neutral or low beta, though it is exposed to specific factors.
                    In extreme cases, it may face significant drawdowns. Generally, it maintains high liquidity through
                    trades in futures, swaps, ETFs, etc., and typically uses moderate leverage (1.5–2.0x) to boost
                    returns.</p>
