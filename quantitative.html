                <h2>Main Text:</h2>
                <p>The early stage of A-share trading was primarily based on technical indicators, but after 2010, value
                    investing became more widely recognized. In recent years, quantitative trading has gained more
                    public attention due to its returns and some sensational news. When people hear about quantitative
                    trading, they usually have two reactions: either it’s something mysterious that only top experts can
                    access, or it’s a scam. So, is quantitative trading really that mysterious?</p>

                <h3>Definition and Simple Understanding of Quantitative Trading</h3>
                <p>Let’s first look at Baidu’s explanation: Quantitative trading refers to the use of advanced
                    mathematical models to replace subjective human judgment, utilizing computer technology to select
                    from massive historical data events that can generate excess returns, thereby greatly reducing the
                    impact of investor emotional fluctuations and avoiding irrational investment decisions in extreme
                    market conditions, whether in a highly optimistic or pessimistic environment.</p>
                <p>Simply put, quantitative trading is a method of trading based on mathematical models and computer
                    programs, relying on data analysis to automatically execute trading strategies for profit. In
                    contrast, subjective trading, which is based on human judgment and experience, is the opposite.
                    Quantitative trading essentially converts past experiences and discovered patterns into mathematical
                    models, writing code for machines to execute the trades. Although the two types of trading are
                    different, the core goal of both is to find ways to make profitable investments.</p>

                <h3>Every Coin Has Two Sides — Advantages and Disadvantages of Quantitative Trading</h3>
                <p>So, what are the advantages of quantitative trading?</p>
                <p>Firstly, there is its objectivity. Quantitative trading is entirely based on data and algorithms,
                    reducing the influence of human emotions and subjective judgment, making decisions more scientific.
                    Secondly, it is efficient and automated. Quantitative trading uses computer algorithms to execute
                    transactions automatically, allowing trades to be made at a higher speed and frequency, reducing
                    manual operation and improving the efficiency and accuracy of trades. Next, its adaptability —
                    quantitative trading can be applied to multiple markets like stocks, futures, and foreign exchange,
                    as well as different asset classes. Finally, it is flexible. Quantitative trading can adopt various
                    trading strategies, respond quickly to market trends, adjust strategies in time, and improve risk
                    resistance, making the investment portfolio more diversified, flexible, and resilient to risks.</p>
                <p>However, every aspect of a phenomenon has its imperfections, and quantitative trading is no
                    exception.</p>
                <p>Firstly, quantitative trading relies on historical data for predictions. However, pure data analysis
                    cannot account for non-quantifiable factors. If the market environment changes, such as through
                    political events or natural disasters, models based solely on historical data may fail, leading to
                    trading losses. Additionally, models may suffer from overfitting during backtesting — they may
                    perform well in historical simulations but fail to generate the expected returns in live trading.
                    Secondly, quantitative trading requires attention to data accuracy and quality, as well as the risk
                    of flaws in the model itself or technical infrastructure. Furthermore, as quantitative trading
                    becomes more popular in the market, competition intensifies, and opportunities to exploit market
                    arbitrage are becoming fewer.</p>

                <h3>History and Development of Quantitative Trading</h3>
                <p>The earliest quantitative trading appeared abroad. In 1969, the first quantitative fund was launched
                    in the United States. The first researchers in this field were mathematicians and statisticians.
                    Many small teams of mathematicians, statisticians, and programmers on Wall Street developed
                    quantitative trading. These teams used computer technology and mathematical models to analyze market
                    data and execute trading strategies. Early representatives included Ed Thorp and James Simons.
                    Interestingly, Ed Thorp initially researched gambling games, particularly blackjack and roulette. In
                    his book Beat the Dealer, he detailed the statistical methods and strategies he used in blackjack,
                    which became a bestseller and earned him recognition. Meanwhile, he began applying his statistical
                    methods to the stock market, seeking price fluctuation patterns and trading opportunities,
                    developing some early quantitative trading strategies. One of his early achievements was discovering
                    an arbitrage opportunity in the options market, known as the “Thorp Arbitrage.” James Simons, in
                    1988, founded the legendary “Renaissance Technologies,” with an average annual return rate of 35%
                    from 1988 to 2015, more than three times the return of the S&P 500 index, outperforming other
                    well-known investment tycoons.</p>
                <p>In China, quantitative investing started later and faced many policy restrictions in the early
                    stages. It wasn’t until 2004 that Hua Bao Trust launched the “Fund Optimal Arbitrage,” which was the
                    first recorded quantitative fund in China. In terms of fund size, the development of quantitative
                    investing in China started later, from its emergence to rapid growth within a short span of over a
                    decade. Although the scale still lags behind international markets, there is immense growth
                    potential. According to statistics from the China Securities Investment Fund Industry Association
                    and CITIC Securities, by the end of 2019, the size of quantitative private equity funds reached 400
                    billion yuan, and by the end of 2022, it grew to 1.5 trillion yuan, accounting for about 25% of the
                    total private equity funds, leaving ample space for future growth.</p>

                <h3>Brief Introduction to the Principles and Methods of Quantitative Trading</h3>
                <p>Based on the information above, readers should now have a basic understanding of quantitative
                    trading. To deepen that understanding, let’s briefly introduce the principles and methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Collection and Processing: Market data, including prices, trading volumes, and various
                        financial data, need to be collected. This data must be cleaned and organized for subsequent
                        analysis.</li>
                    <li>Strategy Development: This is the core of quantitative trading, requiring extensive use of
                        mathematics, statistics, and machine learning algorithms to analyze market data, identifying
                        price trends, patterns, and cycles. Common strategies include trend-following, arbitrage, and
                        statistical arbitrage.</li>
                    <li>Backtesting: After developing a strategy, it needs to be backtested using historical data to
                        evaluate its performance in past market conditions, assessing profitability, risk levels, and
                        more.</li>
                    <li>Optimization and Adjustment: After backtesting, the strategy may need to be optimized and
                        adjusted to improve its ability to generate returns and adapt to market changes.</li>
                    <li>Risk Management: Risk management is crucial in quantitative trading. Indicators like stop-loss,
                        position management, and hedging are commonly used to mitigate trading risks and protect
                        investment capital.</li>
                    <li>Executing Trades: Once a strategy is finalized and tested, live trades can be executed.</li>
                    <li>Monitoring and Adjusting: During live trading, ongoing monitoring is necessary, and the strategy
                        should be adjusted according to market changes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In summary, quantitative trading utilizes mathematical and statistical methods to identify market
                    patterns, developing automated trading strategies to achieve stable and controllable trading
                    results.</p>

                <h3>Some Classic Quantitative Strategies</h3>
                <p>Having briefly introduced the principles and methods of quantitative trading, let us now look at a
                    few classic quantitative strategies:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Alpha Strategy: “Alpha” refers to excess returns—additional gains relative to a market benchmark
                        (often an index). Alpha strategies seek to generate excess returns by exploiting information not
                        fully priced by the market or by taking advantage of mispriced assets.</li>
                    <li>Beta Strategy: In the investment world, “beta” is used in contrast to alpha. Alpha represents
                        excess returns on investments, whereas beta represents the average returns attributable to the
                        overall market. Investors can enhance one or more factor exposures (betas) in their stock
                        selection and allocation of weights, aiming to outperform the traditional index fund’s beta
                        returns.</li>
                    <li>Turtle Trading Strategy: The Turtle Trading strategy, developed by well-known futures traders
                        Richard Dennis and William Eckhardt, is a trend-following approach. It bases trades on tracking
                        market trends: buying when the market enters an uptrend and selling when it moves into a
                        downtrend. Turtle Trading often incorporates strict risk management rules, such as a
                        fixed-percentage risk model, to protect investment capital.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Common Concern: “Have My Stocks Been Dumped by a Quantitative Trader?”</h3>
                <p>Many retail investors may not care much about the standout performance of quantitative trading or the
                    details of how it works; they simply want to know whether their recent limit-up stocks have been
                    “slammed” by quantitative traders. The aspect of quant trading that is most criticized by retail
                    investors is often high-frequency trading. Institutions employing such methods have advantages in
                    trading speed and short selling (through margin financing and securities lending), which indeed can
                    be unfair to ordinary retail investors.</p>
                <p>For instance, when the market opens in the morning, a quantitative fund can rapidly drive up the
                    share price with its capital advantage. Early limit-ups can attract a wave of retail traders to jump
                    on board, locking in the limit-up price. Since the A-share market currently operates on a T+1
                    system, investors who purchase shares cannot sell them until the next trading day. Meanwhile,
                    quantitative traders with securities lending capabilities can borrow shares to sell to the
                    late-arriving retail buyers on the same day. Because they must buy back shares later to return them
                    (short covering), dumping (“smashing” the price) the following day becomes an almost inevitable part
                    of their profit-taking. This low-risk form of arbitrage indeed puts ordinary investors at a
                    disadvantage. Amid loud objections from retail traders, regulatory authorities have already imposed
                    restrictions on short-selling by quantitative funds.</p>


                <h3>Current Legal and Regulatory Status of Quantitative Trading in China</h3>
                <p>As noted above, quantitative funds enjoy capital and securities-lending advantages relative to
                    ordinary retail investors, creating a clear “dimensional reduction” blow to small traders. Moreover,
                    quantitative strategies may become homogeneous, potentially amplifying market volatility and
                    exacerbating information asymmetries. Yet, quantitative trading is developing rapidly in China, with
                    its total scale continuously expanding, so it requires the close attention of securities regulators.
                    Establishing a more comprehensive regulatory framework for quantitative trading is crucial to
                    maintaining market stability.</p>
                <p>Looking at the regulatory framework by main supervisory entities, it can be divided into
                    administrative oversight and market self-regulation. Under administrative oversight, China currently
                    has certain entry requirements for quantitative trading. According to statistics from the China
                    Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), between 2017 and 2021, the number of administrative
                    approvals for public quantitative products decreased each year. Meanwhile, existing regulatory
                    measures rarely include direct penalties; they mainly consist of warnings, supervisory interviews,
                    official letters of caution, or orders to make corrections, focusing on preventing the spread of
                    risks and negative consequences. Of course, administrative sanctions apply directly to serious
                    offenses such as market manipulation and insider trading. From 2001 to 2017, the CSRC punished 117
                    cases of market manipulation. Between 2020 and July 2021 alone, a period of vigorous growth in
                    quantitative trading, there were 176 enforcement cases for market manipulation or insider
                    trading—surpassing the total number in the previous 17 years combined. In terms of market
                    self-regulation, stock exchanges and industry associations can impose discipline or penalties. A
                    2017 case study published by the CSRC illustrated how an exchange detected the use of quantitative
                    trading for the purpose of illegal profit transfer.</p>

                <h3>Discussion on the Social Value of Quantitative Trading</h3>
                <p>In the eyes of many, quantitative trading is merely a tool for savvy professionals to make money, or
                    even a force willing to “smash” and short the market at any cost. But does it truly offer no benefit
                    to society at all?</p>
                <p>Because quantitative trading can rapidly calculate fair values and execute trades at high frequency,
                    it actually dampens price fluctuations of various financial instruments. In the author’s view, its
                    primary value lies in enhancing market efficiency in several ways. First, it helps improve pricing
                    efficiency, pushing product prices closer to their intrinsic values. (One might humorously note that
                    less volatility could, to some degree, slow retail investors’ “bleeding.”) Second, quantitative
                    trading involves a large volume of buy and sell operations, effectively increasing market liquidity.
                    High liquidity makes assets easier to trade and is critical to a healthy market. Furthermore,
                    quantitative trading fosters financial innovation, accelerates the integration of finance and
                    technology, and intensifies market competition, thereby driving improvements in the overall market.
                </p>
                <p>Of course, for quantitative trading to fully realize its positive impact on society, the
                    corresponding legal and regulatory framework must first be robust and comprehensive.</p>

                <h3>Future Development and Prospects of Quantitative Trading</h3>
                <p>Regarding quantitative trading itself, it began developing relatively late in China. Compared with
                    overseas markets, it still trails in terms of fund size, algorithmic strategy design, talent pool,
                    and overall market maturity. Thus, there remains significant room for growth and substantial
                    untapped potential in China.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, as previously mentioned, quantitative trading has inherent pros and cons, faces
                    regulatory challenges, and carries social implications. In the author’s view, if China can refine
                    its regulations and legal framework, and if both practitioners and the public can view quantitative
                    trading rationally, the sector can develop on the right track and create substantial social value.
                </p>

                <h3>Thinking About the Future Through Quantitative Trading</h3>
                <p>As society continues to progress and science and technology advance, many new concepts emerge. In
                    recent times, there has been constant talk of the AI era. Rather than calling the next era the “AI
                    era,” one might say it is the era of data. In today’s world of rapidly evolving electronic
                    information, countless aspects of life are becoming digitalized. In the past, people shopped only in
                    physical stores; nowadays, a smartphone is all you need to browse and place orders. In the past,
                    carrying a wallet with paper cash was essential; now a smartphone alone will get you through the
                    day. The trend toward digitization and information-based systems is clear, and people’s mindsets are
                    shifting in that direction as well.</p>
                <p>Quantitative trading is a prime example of this trend. While traditional fundamental analysis uses
                    various data, quantitative trading goes a step further: it digs beneath basic fundamentals and even
                    uncovers information not previously noticed, transforms it into quantifiable factors, and uses it to
                    build mathematical models that guide trading decisions. This process of discovering underlying
                    information, quantifying it, and summarizing it into a model has immense potential for the
                    future—not just in securities trading. There are countless industries waiting to be explored,
                    quantified, and modeled. For instance, in agriculture, we can continue to identify detrimental
                    factors for crops and convert them into quantitative models, supporting the development of digital
                    agriculture. In healthcare, quantitative methods can be used to track patient data and identify risk
                    factors, leveraging big data and machine learning to predict disease progression and the likelihood
                    of onset, thus advancing digital medicine.</p>
                <p>For most of us who are not in quantitative trading, we can nevertheless learn the mindset it
                    embodies: continually exploring the world, quantifying its elements, and using algorithms to build
                    models. This can deepen our understanding of the world and help us bring about positive changes.</p>

                <h1>What is a Quantitative Hedge Fund?</h1>
                <p>The term "quantitative investing" does not describe a single unified strategy; rather, it explains
                    how specific strategies are developed and implemented. The difference between a quantitative
                    strategy and a discretionary strategy lies in the way the strategy is created and executed.</p>
                <p>Quantitative strategies use computer algorithms to make systematic, automated trading decisions.
                    However, the ultimate responsibility for quantitative trading remains with people—not machines. It
                    is humans who conduct research, decide on strategies, choose which securities to trade, select data,
                    and determine the hardware and connectivity required. Those involved are often called "quants." </p>
                <h2>Classification of Quantitative Trading Strategies</h2>
                <p>Quantitative trading strategies are generally classified based on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Asset classes</li>
                    <li>Signal types</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These two factors typically determine the sub-strategies. For example:</p>
                <p>If a fund mainly uses short-term, technical signals to trade individual stocks with brief holding
                    periods, it may be classified as a statistical arbitrage fund. In contrast, if a fund only trades
                    "macro instruments" such as futures, forex, and bonds—predicting prices as functions of short‐term
                    technical indicators and long‐term fundamental indicators—it may be classified as a quantitative
                    macro fund.</p>
                <h2>Types of Quantitative Hedge Funds</h2>
                <h2>Most Common Quantitative Strategies</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Statistical Arbitrage in Equities</li>
                    <li>Quantitative Equity Market Neutral Strategy</li>
                    <li>Managed Futures/CTA</li>
                    <li>Quantitative Macro</li>
                    <li>Alternative Risk Premia</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This list is not exhaustive; other strategy classifications exist, for example:</p>
                <p>Multi-strategy Quantitative: Funds that trade multiple asset classes simultaneously and/or combine
                    short-term statistical arbitrage with long-term models, often categorized as "statistical
                    arbitrage."</p>
                <p>Quantitative Volatility: Funds that aim to capture changes in volatility are sometimes termed
                    volatility traders, even if executed via a quantitative process. If combined with other quantitative
                    strategies, they are usually classified under “statistical arbitrage.”</p>

                <h2>Statistical Arbitrage in Equities</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Statistical arbitrage funds typically utilize price data and its derivatives (such as correlations,
                    volatility, and other forms of market data like volume and order book information) to detect
                    patterns. By studying historical data, they identify repeatable patterns and data correlations to
                    help managers forecast future stock returns over short periods. Rigorous statistical analysis and
                    backtesting are used to verify relationships. The strategy aims for risk-adjusted returns that
                    exceed those of more “traditional” hedge funds, though actual returns depend heavily on leverage and
                    volatility tolerance.</p>
                <h3>Signal Types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mean Reversion: Seeks to exploit short-term price imbalances where prices are expected to return
                        to their "equilibrium" level.</li>
                    <li>Momentum: Searches for patterns in price data that indicate a continuation of price movements
                        (i.e. trends).</li>
                    <li>Event Driven: Includes factors such as analyst earnings expectations, news sentiment, mergers
                        and acquisitions, stock buybacks, index rebalancing, and insider trading.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Some statistical arbitrage funds may also incorporate long-term models driven by fundamental data. If
                    these fundamentally driven models are the main risk drivers, the fund is closer to a quantitative
                    market neutral strategy (QEMN).</p>
                <h3>Performance Across Markets</h3>
                <p>Statistical arbitrage portfolios generally generate returns on top of broad market movements. During
                    periods of soaring inter-stock correlations and market volatility spikes, statistical arbitrage may
                    experience sharp drawdowns. However, extreme volatility is often followed by attractive
                    opportunities. Environments of low volatility and low trading volume may be unfavorable, while
                    moderate price fluctuations and discrepancies are conducive to success. Sudden risk events or
                    unforeseeable factors may challenge the model.</p>
                <h3>Example Trade</h3>
                <p>Suppose the fund identifies that Coca-Cola and Pepsi have historically been highly correlated. If
                    Pepsi’s stock drops briefly due to a liquidity imbalance, the fund might buy the undervalued Pepsi
                    while shorting the overvalued Coca-Cola, expecting the price ratio to revert to its historical
                    average.</p>
                <h3>Risk/Return Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Market Neutral: Typically operates with very low beta. Other common factor exposures are usually
                    hedged. Leverage may be higher but is managed through stop-losses, position size limits, and factor
                    exposure constraints.</p>
                <h2>Quantitative Equity Market Neutral Strategy (“QEMN”)</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The QEMN strategy uses a blend of fundamental and event-driven data (such as analyst earnings
                    forecasts, financial data) that is processed systematically to score/rank stocks. By means of
                    optimization or simple rules, the strategy constructs a market neutral long-short portfolio while
                    minimizing industry exposures.</p>
                <h3>Signal Types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fundamental Data: Earnings, revenue, profit margins, cash flow, etc.</li>
                    <li>Technical Data: Moving averages, RSI, volume, price momentum, etc.</li>
                    <li>Sentiment Data: News articles, social media posts, analyst reports, etc.</li>
                    <li>Alternative Data: Such as satellite imagery, credit card data, weather patterns, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Machine learning algorithms are used to screen and combine these signals to ultimately build a market
                    neutral long-short portfolio.</p>
                <h3>Performance Across Markets</h3>
                <p>Like statistical arbitrage, QEMN can face challenges during periods of extreme volatility and rising
                    correlations. It tends to perform better when stock prices are more driven by fundamentals and there
                    are reasonable pricing discrepancies.</p>
                <h3>Example Trade</h3>
                <p>
                    Data Collection & Processing: Collect financial statements, earnings reports, and alternative data
                    such as news articles and social media sentiment.<br>
                    Signal Generation: Compute signals for value (e.g. P/E ratio), growth (e.g. earnings growth rate),
                    momentum (price trends), and quality (ROE, debt levels, etc.).<br>
                    Portfolio Construction & Risk Management: Select roughly 100 long and 100 short stocks while
                    ensuring industry and market-cap neutrality, using stop-losses and position limits to manage risk.
                </p>
                <h3>Risk/Return Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Low beta and market neutrality. Some QEMN strategies may exhibit specific style factor exposures (for
                    example, value or momentum) and sometimes include timing signals. Leverage levels are typically in
                    the 3–8x range and are maintained neutrally through hedging.</p>
                <h2>Managed Futures/CTA</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) typically take primarily directional positions in indices or "macro
                    instruments" (such as futures or forex) in a systematic manner. The most common strategy is trend
                    following, using technical price signals to buy rising markets and sell falling ones, and
                    rebalancing positions when trends reverse. As the trend following concept has become popular, some
                    more "generalized" CTA strategies now boast lower fees.</p>
                <h3>Signal Types</h3>
                <p>Most CTAs rely on price and volume data to identify trends. They may also incorporate yield curve
                    information, seasonality, mean reversion, or pattern recognition, and some even include fundamental
                    or alternative data. Short-term high-frequency patterns may also be examined.</p>
                <h3>Performance Across Markets</h3>
                <p>CTAs typically show low correlations with stocks and bonds, often performing well in periods of high
                    volatility or crises while suffering in choppy or low volatility, range-bound markets. They tend to
                    generate significant profits in sustained trending markets; however, abrupt reversals or rapid
                    changes in macro conditions can result in prolonged drawdowns.</p>
                <h3>Example Trade</h3>
                <p>
                    Directional Position: For example, taking long and short positions in stock index futures.<br>
                    Relative Value: For example, trading the spread between Brent and WTI crude oil contracts, or
                    engaging in “curve trading” between different maturities of futures contracts.
                </p>
                <h3>Risk/Return Characteristics</h3>
                <p>
                    Diversification: Spanning stock indices, government bonds, commodity futures, and currency
                    futures.<br>
                    Low Correlation: Generally low correlation with stocks and bonds.<br>
                    High Volatility and Drawdowns: Expected Sharpe ratios are around 0.5–1.0, making them less suitable
                    for investors solely chasing high Sharpe.<br>
                    Capital Efficiency: Margins are typically only 10–25% of total equity.<br>
                    Mechanical Risk Control: The portfolio size is dynamically adjusted based on market conditions.
                </p>
                <h2>Quantitative Macro and Global Asset Allocation (“GAA”)</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Quantitative macro involves analyzing a wide array of economic, market, and other fundamental
                    indicators and making trading decisions based on statistical models. While it overlaps with CTAs in
                    trading futures and other macro instruments, quantitative macro tends to be driven by long-term
                    fundamentals (such as GDP, inflation, and exchange rates).</p>
                <p>Quantitative Macro/GAA funds typically:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus on relative value trading while sometimes taking directional positions.</li>
                    <li>Use a wide range of signals based on economic data, cross-country differences, alternative data,
                        and technical indicators.</li>
                    <li>Have holding periods ranging from several weeks to months, or even shorter.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Signal Types</h3>
                <p>
                    Macro-economic factors: GDP, inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, import/export data, etc.<br>
                    Traditional signals: Value, yield, momentum (trend), etc.<br>
                    More complex elements: Such as weather, transportation data, geopolitical events, and policy
                    changes.
                </p>
                <h3>Performance Across Markets</h3>
                <p>Quantitative macro tends to perform well during economic uncertainty such as recessions or
                    geopolitical crises. However, in stable markets with slow changes or when fundamentals are out of
                    sync with market prices, performance may suffer. Its effectiveness heavily depends on data quality
                    and the adaptability of the models.</p>
                <h3>Example Trade</h3>
                <p>
                    Relative Value Model on Macro Instruments: Trading based on differences in interest rates and
                    inflation forecasts affecting exchange rates.<br>
                    Cross-Asset Strategy: Taking long and short positions by dynamically exploiting relationships
                    between commodities, forex, and bonds.
                </p>
                <h3>Risk/Return Characteristics</h3>
                <p>
                    Similar to CTAs, it features low correlation and high liquidity.<br>
                    Vulnerable to unforeseen risk factors, necessitating careful risk management and model
                    adjustments.<br>
                    It should not exhibit a fixed long or short bias.<br>
                    Higher volatility than most hedge funds yet provides diversified returns in a portfolio.

                <p>Alternative Risk Premia (ARP) strategies aim to systematically harvest returns from specific risk
                    factors such as value, momentum, low volatility, high yield, convergence spreads, or M&A risk
                    premia. The concept is to capture these factor premiums through a replicable and dynamic
                    process—typically at lower fees—thereby diversifying exposures across multiple factors and markets
                    to enhance risk-adjusted returns.</p>
                <h3>Signal Types</h3>
                <p>Common factors include value, momentum, yield differentials, volatility, quality, liquidity, etc.
                    Each factor corresponds to specific trading rules (for example, buying undervalued and selling
                    overvalued stocks; going long on positive momentum and short on negative momentum). It may also
                    include risk arbitrage such as merger arbitrage or convertible arbitrage.</p>
                <h3>Performance Across Markets</h3>
                <p>ARP strategies may perform variably during market turbulence; their attraction lies in low
                    correlation with traditional assets. When asset correlations converge and extreme risk events occur,
                    ARP may also suffer drawdowns. Performance can vary greatly between ARP funds based on the chosen
                    factor mix and hedging methods.</p>
                <h3>Example Trade</h3>
                <p>
                    Spread Trade: Simultaneously buying the undervalued asset and shorting the overvalued one between
                    gold and silver to capture reversion.<br>
                    Carry Trade: Allocating positions to high-yield assets while hedging lower-yield assets by
                    exploiting interest rate or yield differentials.
                </p>
                <h3>Risk/Return Characteristics</h3>
                <p>The strategy is designed to be market neutral or low beta, though it is exposed to specific factors.
                    In extreme cases, it may face significant drawdowns. Generally, it maintains high liquidity through
                    trades in futures, swaps, ETFs, etc., and typically uses moderate leverage (1.5–2.0x) to boost
                    returns.</p>
